# CPE App Translation Guide

## Get started

1. Open the [cpe-pocket](https://crowdin.com/project/cpe-pocket) project on Crowdin
2. Find your locale and start translation. Find more details in [guide for volunteer translators](https://support.crowdin.com/for-volunteer-translators/)

All translated and approved content will be pushed to this repo automatically. You don't need to create any PRs with translation.

Original source can be found in [/locales/en](https://github.com/sws2apps/sws-pocket/tree/main/src/locales/en). If you find any problem with original source, please create a PR with changes directly to `/locales/en`. Crowdin automatically pull all updates within 3 hours.

### Translating What’s New contents

What’s New contents displayed inside this application can also be localized. To learn more on how to do so, please read [this guide](https://github.com/sws2apps/.github/blob/main/docs/WHATSNEW.md).

### I can't find my language on Crowdin

Please create a [new issue](https://github.com/sws2apps/sws-pocket/issues/new?template=new_language_request.yml) in this repo. We would be happy to add the new language so that you can start the translation on Crowdin.
